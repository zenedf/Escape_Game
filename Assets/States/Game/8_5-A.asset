  storyText: 'You feel like you have no other choice. You hurl the poor woman onto
    the floor without stopping as you approach the group. The majority of them immediately
    go for her. You are now able to go around the group of zombies. Four of the zombies
    break off from the group to chase you. You are so close to the exit. You are
    so close to getting to live another day as a mall janitor. You are running faster
    than you ever have before. The zombies are so close behind you that you think
    you can smell their breath. As soon as your burst the the exit doors you see
    a blinding light and hear a man yell, "ON THE GROUND!".


    What do you do?


    1)
    Ignore the man and continue to run. Even though you can''t see right now you
    know your vehicle is practically one row of parking in front of you.


    2)
    Drop to the ground ignoring your base instincts to run until you are free from
    this nightmare.'
