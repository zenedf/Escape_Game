  storyText: 'You can''t believe that actually worked! You have never been good at
    anything in your life. Maybe this is a sign that you won''t die here in this
    mall. Maybe this is a sign that your poor, pathetic, miserable life is about
    to have meaning. Maybe you won''t be eaten by undead humans. Humans that used
    to smear feces and vomitous on the bathroom toilets and walls while laughing
    to themselves. Knowing full well that some pathetic man that has hit rock bottom,
    and given up on ever finding happiness again, will be the one that has to clean
    it up! Your happiness quickly fades as your attention is brought back to the
    exit. There are so many zombies heading your way. You hear a woman screaming.
    You turn to your left to see a woman hitting a zombie with her purse while trying
    to run the opposite direction as you with a broken heel.


    What will you
    do?


    1) Run to the other side of the walkway to try and save her.


    2)
    Continue running towards the exit.'
