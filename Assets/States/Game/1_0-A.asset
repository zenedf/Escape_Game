  storyText: 'You chose to go right. You run through the stampede of humans before
    getting to the herd of zombies. One of them runs at you. You swing your mop at
    its head like a bat. It breaks upon impact leaving the zombie slightly stunned.
    The part of the mop that broke is now pointed like a spear.  Very quickly the
    zombie regains its composure before starting to lunge at you.


    What will
    you do?


    1) Try to pierce the zombie''s brain with your mop spear.


    2)
    Do a spin maneuver you saw in football to get around it and keep running for
    the exit.'
