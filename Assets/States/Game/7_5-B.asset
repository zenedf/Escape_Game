  storyText: 'You try to take the woman''s broken heel off of her foot but cannot
    seem to remove it. You start to panic. You turn around and try to run past the
    first zombie you encountered. You make it to the side of the zombie when it grabs
    the leg of the woman you are carrying which brings you both to the floor. You
    hit your head hard on the tile floor which causes you to black out for a few
    seconds. The women''s screams are probably what caused you to wake up. As you
    come to you see the woman trying desparately to crawl away with a thick blood
    trail behind her. The zombie is next to her eating her severed leg it had just
    procurred. Her screams filled my mind with despair as I looked toward the exit
    doors at the herd of zombies barreling towards us. You have not had a fulfilling
    life. You never married. You have no kids. You barely even knew the warmth of
    a woman, but you will be eaten alive next to one shortly after you cleaned shit
    off the walls in a public bathroom. As you start to feel the teeth and nails
    of beings you have seen in movies and comics puncture your flesh, in the location
    you have cleaned both puke and feces in for the last 10 years, you think to yourself,
    "Fuck this world".
