  storyText: 'You decide to forget about the woman and continue to run towards the
    exit. You turn around hoping you would see that the woman was able to get away
    from the two zombies near you both when you trip on something and sprain your
    ankle. You get back to your feet very quickly before feeling an excruciating
    pain in your ankle. "There''s no way I''m going to make it now", you thought.
    You frantically look around to try to find some kind of weapon you could try
    to use for defense as you limp your way towards the exit when something catches
    your eye. You had tripped over the disembowled corpse of a young child. You recognized
    the child. It was a young girl you had seen in the food court right after you
    got off your lunch break. You remember thinking to yourself, "I wonder if I will
    ever have kids". As you stare into the eyes of this small eight year old dismembered
    child your will to live leaves you. You slowly sit down on the ground still staring
    into her eyes. Her face was the last thing you saw before your limbs and flesh
    were ripped from your body.
