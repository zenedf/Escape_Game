  storyText: 'You have chosen to try and save her. As you start running toward her
    you hurl your mop spear as hard as you can at the zombie that is attacking her.
    You end up immobalizing the zombie by piercing its legs together with the spear
    completely by accident. You then pick up the woman, because by this point she
    is in a state of shock, and start running away from the previous zombie you.
    You are now slower due to the woman and you start to worry. You have a group
    of zombies in front of you and one behind you. "Will this nightmare ever end?"
    you think to yourself as you realize this is the first time you''ve felt a woman''s
    touch in over ten long years. The one behind you is gaining fast. You start to
    panic. You have to do something soon or you will both die.


    What will you
    do?


    1) Use the woman as bait by throwing her to the ground when the group
    of zombies gets closer.


    2) Take the woman''s broken heel, turn around,
    and try to stab it into the head of the one zombie behind you.'
