  storyText: 'You rush out of the bathroom to see why everyone is screaming. You
    were in the middle of cleaning the restroom as you are a janitor that works at
    a mall. You quickly realize that the mall is infested with zombies and killing
    everyone. You know there is an exit to the right of you, but that is where the
    stampede of people are running from. You know there is an exit to the left of
    you if you go up an escalator and go to the other end of the mall. You have no
    cell phone because you''re not allowed to have one on the job, and the security
    guards aren''t answering when you radio them.


    What will you do?


    1)
    Grab your mop to use as a weapon as you run through the stampede of humans and
    zombies on the right to get to the exit.


    2) Immediately go left and start
    running. You have a lot of ground to cover.'
